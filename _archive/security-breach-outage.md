On Tuesday 14th of January 2014, sourceLair got attacked by a botnet that gained root access on our main application server. Despite the magnitude of this breach, we were lucky enough and no data seemed to be stolen or corrupted.

More information about this security breach can be found at the [post mortem we published](http://blog.sourcelair.com/post/73553691323/post-mortem-on-tuesdays-outage-by-security-breach) on Friday 16th of January 2014.

What I would like to state here is that the privacy of our users is our top priority, and that can be verified by what is stated in the post mortem. We took the best security measures we could, so as to ensure no such intrusion happens again.

I apologize both as CEO, in behalf of sourceLair, and as a developer myself, for the frustration this issue caused, since I care about our users privacy as much I care about mine.

Thank you.
